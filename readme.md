#  Hey! 🙋🏻‍♂️Vivallo here!

##  I am a Computer Engineering Student

###  Here are some of my interests and what I'm working on:

  * 🎆 Working on [ Lambda Blog ](https://github.com/Vivallo04/lambda-blog)
  * 🌱 I'm currently learning Rust and Game Development 
  * 💭 Ask me about anything [ here ](https://github.com/Vivallo04/Vivallo04/issues/new) or we can connect on [ LinkedIn ](https://bit.ly/3zm1YjA)
  * 🎮 I have fun developing games and doing full-stack web development 
  * 🤓 Oh! I almost forget. Here's a link to my [ dotfiles ](https://github.com/Vivallo04/dotfiles) (I use Arch btw) 
  * 👨🏻‍💻 Want to do any fun project for the weekend? Sure! I'm [ down ](https://discordapp.com/users/521712126058823701)
  * 💘 I love high-level and low-level programming as much as electronics (and classical music too) 

##  LeetCode Challenge of the Day ⚛

###  Sum of All Subset XOR Totals

The XOR total of an array is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements,
or 0 if the array is empty. Given an array nums, return the sum of all XOR
totals for every subset of nums. An array a is a subset of an array b if a can
be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of b.

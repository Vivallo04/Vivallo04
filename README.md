##  LeetCode Challenge of the Day ⚛

###  Most Popular Video Creator

You are given two string arrays creators and ids, and an integer array views,
all of length n. The ith video on a platform was created by creator[i], has an
id of ids[i], and has views[i] views. The popularity of a creator is the sum
of the number of views on all of the creator's videos. Find the creator with
the highest popularity and the id of their most viewed video. If multiple
creators have the highest popularity, find all of them. If multiple videos
have the highest view count for a creator, find the lexicographically smallest
id. Return a 2D array of strings answer where answer[i] = [creator, id] means
that creator has the highest popularity and idi is the id of their most
popular video. The answer can be returned in any order.

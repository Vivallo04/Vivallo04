##  LeetCode Challenge of the Day ⚛

###  Climbing Stairs

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you
can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the
top?

###  My Solution

```java
class Solution {

    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n == 1 || n == 2)
        {
            return n;
        }
        return climbStairs(n - 1) + climbStairs(n - 2);
    }
}

```

_Note: Leet Code challenges update once a week😉_

##  LeetCode Challenge of the Day ⚛

###  N-Queens

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard
such that no two queens attack each other. Given an integer n, return all
distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any
order. Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens'
placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space,
respectively.

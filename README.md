##  LeetCode Challenge of the Day ⚛

###  Minimum Amount of Time to Collect Garbage

You are given a 0-indexed array of strings garbage where garbage[i] represents
the assortment of garbage at the ith house. garbage[i] consists only of the
characters 'M', 'P' and 'G' representing one unit of metal, paper and glass
garbage respectively. Picking up one unit of any type of garbage takes 1
minute. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array travel where travel[i] is
the number of minutes needed to go from house i to house i + 1. There are
three garbage trucks in the city, each responsible for picking up one type of
garbage. Each garbage truck starts at house 0 and must visit each house in
order; however, they do not need to visit every house. Only one garbage truck
may be used at any given moment. While one truck is driving or picking up
garbage, the other two trucks cannot do anything. Return the minimum number of
minutes needed to pick up all the garbage.

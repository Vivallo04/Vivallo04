##  LeetCode Challenge of the Day ⚛

###  Rotate Image

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90
degrees (clockwise). You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you
have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix
and do the rotation.

##  LeetCode Challenge of the Day ⚛

###  Word Ladder

A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a
dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk
such that: Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter. Every si
for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in
wordList. sk == endWord Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a
dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation
sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

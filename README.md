#  Hey! 🙋🏻‍♂️Vivallo here!

##  I am a Computer Engineering Student

###  Here are some of my interests and what I'm working on:

  * 🎆 Working on [ Lambda Blog ](https://github.com/Vivallo04/lambda-blog)
  * 🌱 I'm currently learning Rust and Game Development 
  * 💭 Ask me about anything [ here ](https://github.com/Vivallo04/Vivallo04/issues/new) or we can connect on [ LinkedIn ](https://bit.ly/3zm1YjA)
  * 🎮 I have fun developing games and doing full-stack web development 
  * 🤓 Oh! I almost forget. Here's a link to my [ dotfiles ](https://github.com/Vivallo04/dotfiles) (I use Arch btw) 
  * 👨🏻‍💻 Want to do any fun project for the weekend? Sure! I'm [ down ](https://discordapp.com/users/521712126058823701)

##  LeetCode Challenge of the Day ⚛

###  Decode Ways

A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the
following mapping: A = 1, B = 2, (...), Z = 26. o decode an encoded message,
all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse
of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, "11106" can be
mapped into: "AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6) "KJF" with the grouping (11
10 6) Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be
mapped into 'F' since "6" is different from "06". Given a string s containing
only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. The test cases are
generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

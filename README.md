##  LeetCode Challenge of the Day ⚛

###  Merge Sorted Array

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing
order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1
and nums2 respectively. Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in
non-decreasing order. The final sorted array should not be returned by the
function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this,
nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements
that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be
ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
